# Rock Rap 'N Roll

This is a fan-made, unofficial port of the now-discontinued Rock Rap N' Roll, a music education game authored by Barry Schuler, Nick Tenbrock and Gary Levenberg at Medior Inc, and published by Paramount Interactive. Released in 1993 RRR allows the user to construct songs in various styles, using studio produced music clips. Mega Rock Rap N' Roll, demonstrated in this app, is an extension of RRR that included more music genres. Convolution reverb was added using the Web Audio ConvolverNode.  Impulse responses used in this project can be found at https://fokkie.home.xs4all.nl/IR.htm
